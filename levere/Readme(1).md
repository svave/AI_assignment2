# Assignment 2: Machine Learning

We have chosen usecase 2, which is to predict the stock market price for Norwegian airlines.
We tried to use linear regression which didnt work so well. We then tried to use Random Forest Regression, which did its predictions alot better. Se files: LinearStonks and TreeStonks

We have done some research and found out that in our case, it is a regression problem. As the Lab5 states: "Itâ€™s used to predict values within a continuous range, (e.g. sales, price, income)" We are not trying to determine if the stock is going to go up or down, which would be more of a classification problem.
